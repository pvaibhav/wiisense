WiiSense is a PureData external (currently Windows-only) for using acceleration and button data from the Nintendo Wiimote. It can also set the rumble and LEDs on the Wiimote. This was originally created for IPEM, University of Ghent.

The dll uses the Wiim library to access the Wiimote.

You need a proper Bluetooth stack. Currently tested only using BlueSoleil.
